# External LiDAR

We have a [Livox MID-360](https://www.livoxtech.com/mid-360) LiDAR which mounts on the back of the Go2 to provide a more comprehensive scan of the environment when compared to the built-in LiDAR.

This has not yet been set up as we need to source/create a mounting plate and a cable to connect to the Jetson.
