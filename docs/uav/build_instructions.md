## Carbon Fibre Machining Companies

The base frame of the UAV is machined from a Carbon Fibre sheet. Unless you want to do this yourself, we recommend using one of the following companies for manufacturing the frames:

- [CNC Madness](https://cncmadness.com/) (Canada) — Good price and quality, great if you are not in a rush
- [Carbon Fibre Tubes](https://www.carbonfibretubes.co.uk/) (UK) — More expensive than CNC Madness, but they are located in Fareham and registered as a supplier with the university so better for quick turnarounds

!!!tip "Altering the frame design"
    If you need to change the design of the frame, maybe to accommodate different components, you are strongly encouraged to 3D print a prototype before ordering the frame. This will help you identify any potential issues with the design before investing significant time and money into having the frames manufactured.

## Assembly

!!!note "Nylon Locking Nuts"
    Nylon Locking Nuts (A.K.A. Nylocks) are effectively single use. Once they have been tightened through the nylon ring they should not be removed otherwise the locking ring will be damaged and performance will degrade. Before tightening the bolt, ensure you will not need to remove that component again. It may be a good idea to leave all of the locking nuts off until the end of assembly.

1. Pass the M3x16(?) countersunk bolts from the bottom of the frame through the 4 larger countersunk holes and use an M3 nut to lock the bolt in place. Ensure the bolt is seated in the countersink bore on the underside of the frame. Place the flight controller (with the rubber grommets) onto the bolts and then use 4 M3 Nylock nuts to tightly lock the flight controller in place. Make sure the arrow on the board is on the top and facing forwards.
2. Attach the cable between the flight controller and the ESC, then pass the M2x14(?) coutnersunk bolts through the smaller 4 holes in the middle of the frame. Then use an M2 nut to lock those bolts to the frame. Place the ESC (with the rubber grommets) onto the bolts and then use 4 M2 Nylocks to secure the ESC in place.
3. Pass 4 M2x8 bolts through the 4 motor mount holes on one arm. Place the motor on top and thread the bolts into the motors. Repeat for the other 3 motors.
4. Place the radio module and the GNSS module into their respective mounts, and place them either side of the rear mounting arm. Pass one M3x14 bolt through each hole, and use an M3 Nylock to secure each bolt and keep the mounts flush against the frame.
5. Place the optical flow board on the underside of the mount between the front motors. Use M3x12 bolts and M3 Nylocks to secure the sensor to the frame. Ensure the arrow on the board is facing forwards.
6. Align the battery cage below the frame and use 4 M3 bolts through the mounting holes. The bolt length will depend on whether standoffs or Nylock nuts are used. Attach the relevant 'nut' on the other side of the bolt and ensure the battery cage does not move.
