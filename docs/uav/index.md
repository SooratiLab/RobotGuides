# UAVs

<!-- Platform may be renamed to Research-focused, expandable, autonomous drone (READ) -->

This directory contains the documentation for our custom UAV platform.

Eventually we should have at least 15 UAVs.

If you have not used these drones before, please **email Toby Godfrey (t.godfrey ~at~ soton.ac.uk) BEFORE you start working with them** and see the [Getting Started](getting_started.md) page.

For all other information about the Go2s, please navigate to the relevant page.

_These UAVs were designed and developed by Toby Godfrey. For a detailed discussion, feel free to email him at t.godfrey ~at~ soton.ac.uk._
